Git and GitHub  

Git and GitHub are not the same thing. Git is an open-source, version control tool created in 2005 by developers working on the Linux operating system; GitHub is a company founded in 2008 that makes tools which integrate with git. You do not need GitHub to use git, but you cannot use GitHub without using git. There are many other alternatives to GitHub, such as GitLab, BitBucket, and “host-your-own” solutions such as gogs and gittea. All of these are referred to in git-speak as “remotes”, and all are completely optional. You do not need to use a remote to use git, but it will make sharing your code with others easier.

## 2. What is Git?
   
To understand GitHub, first there is need to have an understanding of Git. 
Git is a version control (similar to Google Docs, but better, where you can keep track of the changes made by different people at different time) system that keep track of the changes in your computer files and you may work together with multiple people. Although it is designed for software development, you can still use it to keep track of your personal files.


## 3.  Why GitHub?

When developers create something (an app, for example)they make constant changes to the code, releasing new versions up to and after the first official release.

Version control systems keep these revisions straight, storing the modifications in a central repository. This allows developers to easily collaborate, as they can download a new version of the software, make changes, and upload the newest revision. Every developer can see these new changes, download them, and contribute.

Github is one of the online project hosting that use Git. This is also the services that are going to host Website, known as Github pages that uses Jekyll, at zero cost.
