## 2. What is Markdown?
  
Markdown is a way to write content for the web. Its a language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.
Text written in Markdown can be easily shared between computers, mobile phones, and people. It’s quickly becoming the writing standard for academics, scientists, writers, and many more. Websites like GitHub use Markdown to style their comments.

## 3. Why Markdown?
   
Markdown can be used for everything. People use it to create websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation.

Markdown is future proof. Even if the application you’re using stops working at some point in the future, you’ll still be able to read your Markdown-formatted text using a text editing application. This is an important consideration when it comes to books, university theses, and other milestone documents that need to be preserved indefinitely.

Markdown is everywhere. Websites like GitHub support Markdown, and lots of desktop and web-based applications support it.

## 4. How does it work?

4 steps:
- Create a Markdown file using a text editor or a  dedicated Markdown application. The file should have an .md or .markdown extension.
- Open the Markdown file in a Markdown         application.
- Use the Markdown application to convert the Markdown file to an HTML document.
- View the HTML file in a web browser or use the Markdown application to convert it to another file format, like PDF.
